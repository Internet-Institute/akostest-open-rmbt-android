        <h3>2.1.2. The purpose of personal data collection</h3>

        <h4>Primary database</h4>

        <p>
            All data acquired by the Agency acquired through the use of AKOS Test Net and results of all measurements (all data listed under section 2.1.1), which are carried out by users or the Agency are recorded in the primary database. The primary database can only be accessed by the employees of the Agency responsible for the management of the database. Users and the Agency shall use the AKOS Test Net system to measure the capacity and quality of network services provided by operators or service providers. The Agency shall use the collected data in order to monitor the situation and to carry out regulatory supervision in the field of fixed or mobile broadband services. The system shall show the Agency where in Slovenia and with which ISPs there are potential problems with access to internet services, where there is no mobile or wireless signal and whether operators are expanding the coverage of the specified white spots with mobile and wireless access pursuant to decisions on the assignment of radio frequencies.
        </p>
        <p>
            All data listed under section 2.1.1 are kept in the primary database for a period of 10 years, with the exception of the user's public IP address, which is kept for a period of 6 months.
        </p>

        <p>
            The user's public IP address is being processed in order to determine the network operator, to identify potential improper use of the system and in order to prepare a history of measurements for a specific user. After the completed test the only the network address of the IP address (anonymized public IP address) is recorded in the database and can be accessed in accordance with the open data principle. The full IP address is recorded in the primary database, but shall not be disclosed to public and can be viewed by the user only in the mobile app under "Details" or in the browser under the "History" tab.Data on WLAN network ID is stored for the purposes of interpreting his own results of users by having overlook on this information to all his measurements stored. This is critical especially when different WiFi access points are used.
        </p>

        <h4>Public database</h4>

        <p>
            The selected and anonymised data from completed measurements (marked with one asterisk ( * )) are published online and can be accessed through the www.akostest.net website, while allowing the interested public to gain an independent and realistic insight in the state of mobile, wireless and fixed communication systems and internet services on the territory of Slovenia. They provide users with information on the network coverage for a specific network or service provider at the level of regions, cities, districts or the most common regular communication routes. Information on mobile coverage is especially important for users, who travel on Slovenian territory on a daily basis, or users without the possibilities to access fixed broadband networks.        </p>

        <p>
            The data stored in the public database are kept for a period of 10 years.
        </p>

        <h4>Protection of personal data</h4>

        <p>The agency takes care of information security and security of premises and application system software. Accordingly, the agency has taken appropriate organizational and technical security measures to protect the personal data of individuals against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and other illegal and unauthorized forms of processing. Information systems are protected by anti-virus programs and a firewall. The data are not exported to third countries and are not passed on to unauthorized third parties. After the retention period, the agency anonymizes personal data so that it can no longer be linked to a specific individual.
        </p>

        <h4>Individual rights regarding data processing</h4>

        <p>In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation, the individual has the following, in particular from the protection of personal data, rights:</p>
